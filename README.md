<h1>Generating Users in Active Directory</h1>
Welcome back again!  In this project we will focus on populating our domain by generating numerous users.  This project is a bit shorter but it is an integral part to our goal of simulating multiple scenarios that can occur when using Active Directory.
<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

-  Please complete the following before beginning this project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/christianDCdev/active-directory-setup">Setup for Active Directory Infrastructure</a>
    - <a href="https://github.com/christianDCdev/ad-deploy-and-config">Active Directory Deployment and Configuration</a>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Populate our domain by creating additional users

<h2>Project Steps</h2>

<h3>&#9312; Login to DC-1 VM</h3>
<p>

- Login to DC-1 VM via Remote Desktop as "Jane Doe" (username: jane_admin)
  
</p>

<h3>&#9313; Use PowerShell to Create Users</h3>

<p>

- Within DC-1 VM, open "Windows PowerShell ISE" application as an administrator
- Create a new file, if one is not already displayed
- Copy and paste the contents of this <a href="https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1">script</a> into PowerShell ISE file, then save it

</p>
<br />

<h3>&#9314; Verify in Active Directory that user have been successfully created</h3>

<p>

- Once script is done running, open "Active Directory Users and Computers" application
- Find the "_EMPLOYEES" folder
- Right click folder and select "Refresh" to see if the users have been created

</p>
<br />

<h3>&#9315; Login as one of the newly created users</h3>

<p>

- Choose any newly created user from the Active Directory list
- To ensure the script has worked, you can try to log in to Client-1 VM as the user you chose
  - Example: If the name of the user you chose is "lewa.juwa", then the login username will be "mydomain.com\lewa.juwa"E
  - NOTE: The password can be found at the top of the script.  It will be the same for all users.
